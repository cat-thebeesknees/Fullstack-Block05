        <p>
            bear, (family Ursidae), any of eight species of large short-tailed carnivores found in the Americas, Europe,
            and Asia. The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is the smallest, often weighing less than 50 kg (110 pounds).
            The largest bear is either the Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi, a subspecies of Alaskan brown bear;
            see also grizzly bear) or the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), depending upon which measurements are
            considered; either of these bears can weigh up to 720 kg (1,600 pounds). The black bear (Ursus americanus)
            is common in parts of the United States and Canada. Bears are generally omnivorous, but dietary preferences
            range from seals for the entirely carnivorous polar bear to assorted vegetation for the largely herbivorous
            spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) eats only bamboo. Usually
            gaining weight beforehand, most bears sleep fitfully through much of the winter, but they do not truly
            hibernate. Despite their bulk, most bears climb with ease and swim strongly.

        <p>
            giraffe, any of four species of ruminants classified in the genus Giraffa. The giraffe is the tallest of all
            mammals. It reaches an overall height of 18 ft (5.5 m) or more. The legs and neck are extremely long. The
            giraffe has a short body, a tufted tail, a short mane, and short skin-covered horns. The back slopes
            downward to the hindquarters. The coat is pale buff, with reddish brown spots. The giraffe feeds primarily
            on acacia leaves. It lives in herds on savannas and in open bush country and is native to most of
            sub-Saharan Africa. Giraffes are still numerous in eastern Africa, where they are protected, but hunting has
            reduced their populations elsewhere. The only other member of the family Giraffidae is the okapi.

            lion, Large, powerfully built cat (Panthera leo), the proverbial “king of beasts.” It is now found mainly in
            parts of sub-Saharan Africa, though about two hundred constitute an Asiatic race living under strict
            protection in India. Lions inhabit grassy plains and open savanna. The male is 6–7 ft (1.8–2.1 m) long,
            excluding the 3-ft (1-m) tail, stands about 4 ft (1.2 m) high at the shoulder, and weighs 370–500 lbs
            (170–230 kg). The female, or lioness, is considerably smaller. The male’s coat is usually buff yellow or
            orange-brown; lionesses are more consistently tawny or sandy. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his
            mane. Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride, often consisting of about 15
            individuals. Lionesses are the chief hunters. They prey on animals of all sizes, including hippopotamuses,
            but prefer wildebeests, antelopes, and zebras. After eating, a lion may rest for a week.

        <p>
            monkey, Any member of two tropical anthropoid primate groups: Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.
            Almost all species are tropical or subtropical, and almost all are diurnal. Most species are arboreal, using
            all four limbs to leap from tree to tree. They can sit upright and stand erect. Most species run along
            branches rather than swinging arm over arm like the apes. Monkeys are highly social omnivores, organized in
            clans as large as several hundred individuals headed by an old male. Sexually mature males of all species
            are always potent, and all nonpregnant females have a monthly menstrual cycle. Most species bear a single
            young, which is reared by the mother for years.

        </header>

        <p>
            alligator, (genus Alligator), either of two crocodilians related to the tropical American caimans (family
            Alligatoridae). Alligators, like other crocodilians, are large animals with powerful tails that are used
            both in defense and in swimming. Their eyes, ears, and nostrils are placed on top of their long head and
            project slightly above the water when the reptiles float at the surface, as they often do. Alligators can be
            differentiated from true crocodiles by the form of their jaw and teeth. Alligators possess a broad U-shaped
            snout and have an “overbite”; that is, all the teeth of the lower jaw fit within (are lingual to) the teeth
            of the upper jaw. The large fourth tooth on each side of the alligator’s lower jaw fits into a socket in the
            upper jaw. Usually, no lower teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. In contrast, true crocodiles have a
            narrow V-shaped snout, and the large fourth tooth on each side of the lower jaw projects outside the snout
            when the mouth is closed. Alligators are carnivorous and live along the edges of permanent bodies of water,
            such as lakes, swamps, and rivers. They commonly dig burrows in which they rest and avoid weather extremes.
            The average life span of alligators is about 50 years in the wild.
